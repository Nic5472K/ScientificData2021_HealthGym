This folder contains the HIV datasets.

###===###
There are 2 files in this folder:
  i) ZZZ_C001_FakeHIV_part1.csv; and
 ii) ZZZ_C001_FakeHIV_part2.csv.

GitHub does not allow me to upload files larger than 25MBs, and
that's the reason why the dataset was split into two.

Together, there are 8,916 synthetic patients in total:
  i) The first 4,459 synthetic patient data are in part 1; and
 ii) the remaining 4,457 synthetic patient data are in part 2. 

For more information, please contact Nic at n.kuo@unsw.edu.au .
