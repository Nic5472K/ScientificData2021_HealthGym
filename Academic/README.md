Purpose of this Folder:
Our WGAN-GP codes, shared to facilitate future research and build collaboration.

Note,
it might be helpful to first try out the codes in the Demo version. 
:)

###===###
The acute hypotension folder includes 
  the SQL query codes,
  the codes for data-preprocessing and,
  the codes for model building.

#---
The sepsis folder includes
  fully commented scripts for running the WGAN-GP.
  SQL and data-preprocessing codes are not provided here
    because we use the codes of Dr. Matthieu Komorowski from
    https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/AIClinician/AIClinician
    - Their SQL codes are in 
        AIClinician_Data_extract_MIMIC3_140219.ipynb
    - and their data-preprocessing (with inclusion/exclusion criteria) is in
        AIClinician_sepsis3_def_160219.m
  Please refer to our appendix on
  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01784-7
  for in-depth instructions of using Komorowski's codes.
