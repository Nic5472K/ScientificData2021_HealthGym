# Health Gym — Updated Repository

We’ve moved!
The **official and actively maintained Health Gym repository** is now available here:

**[https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI)**

---

### Why the Move

The new repository provides a fully updated and expanded version of the Health Gym project -- including all recent models, blogs, and graphical abstracts. It now integrates:

* **GANs, hybrid VAE-GANs, and diffusion models** for realistic, privacy-preserving EMR synthesis
* **Hands-on tutorials and blog posts** (Health Gym v1–v3)
* **Education-ready datasets** for teaching, benchmarking, and research reproducibility
* **Ethics-approved (UNSW HC210661)** and rigorously validated synthetic datasets
* **Expanded references** and visual walkthroughs for each model generation phase

### Deprecation Notice

**This repository (2022)** —
[`https://github.com/healthgym/healthgym`](https://github.com/healthgym/healthgym) —
is **archived** and kept for citation continuity (Scientific Data, 2022).
Please update your bookmarks, citations, and forks to the **new active repository** above.

Two versions of the code can be found in this repository
 	A) Demo: with descriptions on preprocessing the ground truth dataset
and
 	B) Academic: with the codes commented line by line

Note:
We are not the data custodians and we do not (and cannot) provide you
the ground truth datasets for acute hypotension, sepsis, and ART for HIV.
