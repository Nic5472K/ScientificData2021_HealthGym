Two versions of the code can be found in this repository
 	A) Demo: with descriptions on preprocessing the ground truth dataset
and
 	B) Academic: with the codes commented line by line

Note:
We are not the data custodians and we do not (and cannot) provide you
the ground truth datasets for acute hypotension, sepsis, and ART for HIV.
